<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/"><img src="../assets/images/Chihiro.webp" height="200" alt="a girl sitting in a car with a bouquet"/></a>
<h3>Spirited Away (2001)</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the beautiful images and the story. Oh also the musics!
    It was probably the first movie that I've ever watched in a cinema.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117008/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_7_tt_8_nm_0_q_mathilda"><img src="../assets/images/Mathilda.jpg" height="200" alt="a girl with two adults by her sides"/></a>
<h3>Mathilda (1996)</h3>
<p>I watched it on HBO at home with my mom. I think back then I probably related myself to the main character-Matilda.</p>

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_1_nm_7_q_l%25C3%25A9on%2520"><img src="../assets/images/Léon.webp" height="200" alt="a man and a girl"/></a>
<h3>Léon (1994)</h3>
<p>It's a French move starred by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. She was only 12 years old when she was playing in this movie! </p>
