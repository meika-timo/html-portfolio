<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Meika. I live in Germany with my dog Lukas. <br />
  It's my 98203... time trying to get into coding! <br />
  But I am confident that this time it would be the most successful!
</p>

<p>I am a Virgo, so does my dog. He could be a total douche bag sometimes but I still love him to death! <br />
  That's probably my biggest toxic trait!
</p>

<p>My favorite food is Udon with seafood! <br />
  Currently, I am living in Oldenburg. It's a small town on the north-east of Germany.<br />
  Authentic Japanese food or Asian cuisine doesn't exist here. <br />
  People tend to prefer purely paprika diat... Bruhhhh
